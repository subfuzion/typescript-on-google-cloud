# Set up your account

To use Google Cloud, you'll need a Google account and billing account.

1. Set up a Google account
2. Set up a billing account

### 1. Set up a Google account

Visit [https://cloud.google.com/](https://cloud.google.com/).

If you don't already have a Google Account, then sign up by clicking **Get started for free**.

> Organizations are outside of this scope of this guide. See [here](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#acquiring) if you want to set up an organization.

With an account, you get access to both

* a Free Trial
* a Free Tier

The [Free Trial](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#free-trial) provides $300 of Cloud Billing credits to pay for resources for 90 days while you learn about Google Cloud.

The [Free Tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#free-tier) provides access to Google Cloud products for free beyond the Free Trial as long as you stay below the Free Tier [limits](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#free-tier-usage-limits).

### 2. Enable billing

If you use the _Free Trial_, [Google creates a billing account](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/7006543?hl=en\_) for you and credits $300 to your account.

Once the free trial period ends, you'll be able to continue to use the _Free Tier_, but you must set up a [billing account](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) to cover any costs that exceed free tier limits.
